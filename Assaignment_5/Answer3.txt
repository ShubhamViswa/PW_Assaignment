Question 3 -> What are the benefits of using meta tags?

Answer 3 -> Benefits of Using Meta Tags :- 

  1. Improve SEO: 
         Meta tags like the <title> and <meta name="description"> help search engines understand the content and relevance of your page. 

  2. Better User Experience: 
        Meta tags can enhance the user experience by providing clear and relevant information about the page. For example, the <meta name="viewport"> tag ensures your site is mobile-friendly, while the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag ensures proper character encoding.

  3. Enhanced Accessibility:
        Certain meta tags can contribute to a better overall user experience and accessibility. For instance, specifying the character set ensures that text is rendered correctly across different devices and browsers.

  4. Browser Control: 
        Tags like <meta name="robots"> can control how search engines index and follow your pages. For example, you can use this tag to prevent indexing of certain pages or to prevent following links on a page.

  5. Enhanced Click-Through Rate (CTR):
        A well-written meta description can entice users to click on your link from search engine results pages (SERPs). A compelling description helps users understand what your page is about and why itâ€™s relevant to their search.
