Question 4 -> Write a short note on Tag and Element with an example?

Answer ->   

Tag => A tag is a piece of text enclosed in angle brackets (< >) that specifies how content should be structured or formatted on a webpage. Tags are the building blocks of HTML.

   Tags can be classified into two categories: 
        1. Opening tag <tagname>
        2. Closing tag </tagname>

Example -> <p> _ _ _ _ </p>

Element  => An element in HTML consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The element defines the structure and content of a webpage. An element can include text, other elements, attributes, and more.

Example ->  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
